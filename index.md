# JG RTX

JG RTX is an open-source Minecraft resource pack with a [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). The [resource pack](https://github.com/jasonjgardner/jg-rtx/releases) and texture assets are free to download on [this project's GitHub repository](https://github.com/jasonjgardner/jg-rtx).

__This pack is in early phases of development.__ There currently is no theme in mind. *Many textures have nothing to do with the block description!* The block textures/assignments will change frequently, and perhaps drastically, during development. This resource pack is intended to be used in Creative Mode and only in the Overworld dimension. Blocks from the Nether and the End have been repurposed.

## It's Free

I'm so tired of following AdFly links or making Patreon contributions to download Minecraft resource packs. Aren't you? There are [better things](https://donate.doctorswithoutborders.org/onetime.cfm) to spend your money on than Minecraft textures.

### Open-Source / Share-Alike

I hope to make __a bunch__ of textures. So many that I won't know what to do with them. Anyone ambitious enough to create their own resource pack is welcome to copy, modify, and redistribute these textures â€” as long as the resource pack is also freely distributed (if published) and the amazing, benevolent original author gets some credit: [Jason Gardner](https://jasongardner.co)
